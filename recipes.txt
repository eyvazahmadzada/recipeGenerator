FRENCH ------------------------------------

1) Soupe à l'oignon
---- Ingredients ----
700g onions
40g butter
2 tbsp flour
1.75 litres beef stock
1 glass of white wine
Baguette to toast
Gruyère or Emmenthal

---- Directions ----
STEP 1
Peel and thinly slice 700g onions, then leave them to soften in 40g butter and a small 
glug of olive oil over a low to medium heat. Stir them regularly. They are ready when 
they are soft, sticky, sweet and deep gold in colour. Some add a pinch of sugar at 
this point to help the onions caramelise. Stir in a couple of tablespoons of flour, 
cook for 3 or 4 minutes, then pour in 1.75 litres of boiling beef stock and a glass 
of white wine. Partially cover with a lid and leave to simmer for a good 45 minutes.

STEP 2
Season, ladle into deep, heatproof bowls, place several thin slices of toasted baguette on to 
each, then cover with thinly sliced Gruyère or Emmenthal. Bake in a hot oven for 20 minutes 
or grill until the bread is toasted and the cheese has melted but not browned.

STEP 3
The trick to getting this soup right is that the onions caramelise - they must cook for at 
least 35-40 minutes over a low to moderate heat. Only when the onions are soft enough to 
crush easily between finger and thumb can you add the flour and stock.

2) Flamiche
---- Ingredients ----
1 shortcrust or puff pastry
4 large leeks
2 eggs
1 glass of milk
20 cl of heavy cream
50g butter
2 pinches of salt
5 turns of the pepper mill
1 drop of oil

---- Directions ----
STEP 1
Preheat the oven th.7 (210 ° C). Wash the leeks, remove the greens and cut the whites 
into slices. Then brown them in butter and oil. To go faster and put less fat, you can 
pre-cook them for 5 to 6 minutes in the pressure cooker. Cook them over low heat for 
about 30 min in a sauté pan (if pre-steaming, reduce the time to 10 min).

STEP 2
Spread the dough in a pie dish, prick the pie shell with a fork, then place the cooked leeks 
on top. Beat the eggs, milk, cream, salt and pepper to your liking. Cover the leeks with 
this preparation.

STEP 3
Bake for 35 minutes. When your flamiche is cooked and golden brown, take it out of the oven 
and serve it with a good, well-seasoned green salad.
