Dolma

1 1/2 kg ground veal
1 cup rice
2 onion
1 coriander
2 1/2 stick butter

STEP 1
Mix ground veal, rice, butter, and spices, wrap small portion in a grape/beetroot leave 
and put into a pot.

STEP 2
Add boiling water into the pot, but don't let it cover the 'rolls'. Put a plate on top and 
slightly press the rolls, making sure the water doesn't cover the plate completely. Remove 
extra water if needed. Let it boil on a low fire for about 40 min or until the leaves will 
become soft enough.
