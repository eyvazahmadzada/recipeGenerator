ROASTED AUBERGINE & TOMATO CURRY
---- Ingredients ----
600g baby aubergines, sliced into rounds
3 tbsp olive oil
2 onions, finely sliced
2 garlic cloves, crushed
tsp garam masala
tsp turmeric
tsp ground coriander
400ml can chopped tomatoes
400ml can coconut milk
pinch of sugar (optional)
1/2 small pack coriander, roughly chopped
rice or chapatis, to serve

---- Directions ----
STEP 1
Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Toss the aubergines in a roasting tin with 2 tbsp olive oil, 
season well and spread out. Roast for 20 mins or until dark golden and soft.

STEP 2
Heat the remaining oil in an ovenproof pan or flameproof casserole dish and cook the onions 
over a medium heat for 5-6 mins until softening. Stir in the garlic and spices, for a few 
mins until the spices release their aromas.

STEP 3
Tip in the tomatoes, coconut milk and roasted aubergines, and bring to a gentle simmer. 
Simmer for 20-25 mins, removing the lid for the final 5 mins to thicken the sauce. 
Add a little seasoning if you like, and a pinch of sugar if it needs it. Stir through 
most of the coriander. Serve over rice or with chapatis, scattering with the remaining coriander.
