Soupe à l'oignon
---- Ingredients ----
700g onions
40g butter
2 tbsp flour
1.75 litres beef stock
1 glass of white wine
Baguette to toast
Gruyère or Emmenthal

---- Directions ----
STEP 1
Peel and thinly slice 700g onions, then leave them to soften in 40g butter and a small 
glug of olive oil over a low to medium heat. Stir them regularly. They are ready when 
they are soft, sticky, sweet and deep gold in colour. Some add a pinch of sugar at 
this point to help the onions caramelise. Stir in a couple of tablespoons of flour, 
cook for 3 or 4 minutes, then pour in 1.75 litres of boiling beef stock and a glass 
of white wine. Partially cover with a lid and leave to simmer for a good 45 minutes.

STEP 2
Season, ladle into deep, heatproof bowls, place several thin slices of toasted baguette on to 
each, then cover with thinly sliced Gruyère or Emmenthal. Bake in a hot oven for 20 minutes 
or grill until the bread is toasted and the cheese has melted but not browned.

STEP 3
The trick to getting this soup right is that the onions caramelise - they must cook for at 
least 35-40 minutes over a low to moderate heat. Only when the onions are soft enough to 
crush easily between finger and thumb can you add the flour and stock.
