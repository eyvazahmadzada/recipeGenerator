Flamiche
---- Ingredients ----
1 shortcrust or puff pastry
4 large leeks
2 eggs
1 glass of milk
20 cl of heavy cream
50g butter
2 pinches of salt
5 turns of the pepper mill
1 drop of oil

---- Directions ----
STEP 1
Preheat the oven th.7 (210 ° C). Wash the leeks, remove the greens and cut the whites 
into slices. Then brown them in butter and oil. To go faster and put less fat, you can 
pre-cook them for 5 to 6 minutes in the pressure cooker. Cook them over low heat for 
about 30 min in a sauté pan (if pre-steaming, reduce the time to 10 min).

STEP 2
Spread the dough in a pie dish, prick the pie shell with a fork, then place the cooked leeks 
on top. Beat the eggs, milk, cream, salt and pepper to your liking. Cover the leeks with 
this preparation.

STEP 3
Bake for 35 minutes. When your flamiche is cooked and golden brown, take it out of the oven 
and serve it with a good, well-seasoned green salad.
